* Coq proofs
  - congruence does not work with equality on rationals
  - write a proper tactic to do computation of constants + normalizing of formulas
    (instead of relying on omega)

* Simplex
  - Fix the schmilblik with multiple/repeated solving with int variables

* Meta-variable extension
  - limit the number of instanciations ?
