* Coq proofs
  - congruence does not work with equality on rationals
  - set constants to be variables instead of 0-ary functions (Type difference for context).

* Simplex
  - Fix the schmilblik with multiple/repeated solving with int variables

* Meta-variable extension
  - limit the number of instanciations ?
